## Running the Backend
Follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have python 3.6 installed (virtual environment is fine) and are using it.
2. Install pipenv: ```pip install pipenv```
3. Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal
4. Run ```pipenv shell```
5. Once in the new virtual environment run ```pipenv install``` to install the dependencies in the pipfile
6. Run the server with ```python run.py```
7. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and see if the message **Server works fine, congrats!** is returned.
